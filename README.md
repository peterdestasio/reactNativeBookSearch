# reactNativeBookSearch
A sample application for React Native to show a list of book and look into it.

This is mainly for me to learn React Native.

To start developing, run:
```
npm install
```

Then run

```
react-native run-ios
```
or
```
react-native run-android
```

Excuse the crap code, this is going to be a learning project after all.
